**[SOLO PROJECT] URL Saver (Google Chrome Extension)**

One of the solo projects I created during my learning in Scrimba's Fullstack Developer Path. In this project, I applied:

- Extensive application of the HTML, CSS, Javascript stack.
- Utilized Chrome's API to fetch the current tab of Chrome Browser.

In order to use this chrome extension, kindly download this repository.

Open Google Chrome then proceed to Manage Extensions.

Toggle the developer mode and then select "Load unpacked"

Select the whole folder.

**Enjoy!**
